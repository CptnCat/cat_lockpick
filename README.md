# ✍️ Description
Lockpick script for your FiveM server.

# ⭐ Features
- Configurable alarm during lockpicking
- Option to keep or remove the item after use
- Customizable export for any minigame

# 👀 Usage
I searched the FiveM forum and noticed there were only lockpick minigames, but no complete lockpick scripts. So, I decided to release this lockpick script.
